# Grow-A-Plant
A Python application with a graphical interface developed to run on a RaspberryPi with temperature and light sensors to track potential plant growth. This application was developed with a team for a term project in our Operating Systems class. Thanks to Tegan Wall and Jake Parras on their development efforts. This repo is meant archive the project and add some additional features to make use easier.

Install Instructions:
First copy the repo and run "pip install ." at the highest directory to download all required libraries. From there, you can run main.py directly. A DHT sensor must be connected in order for the application to run. The sensor is referenced by board.D21 as default, but this should be altered depending on how the user's breadboard is set-up.
