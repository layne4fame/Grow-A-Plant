# Grow-A-Plant
A Python application with a graphical interface developed to run on a RaspberryPi with temperature and light sensors to track potential plant growth. This application was developed with a team of three for a term project in an operating systems class. Thanks to Tegan Wall and Jake Parras on their development efforts. This repo is meant to archive the project and add some additional features to make use easier.

# Instructions:
First, copy the repo and run `pip install .` in the command line at the root directory to install all required libraries. From there, you can run main.py directly.

The temperature sensor is referenced by board.D21 as default, but this should be altered depending on how the user's breadboard is set-up.
